# ipm-agda

This repository contains Agda versions of the proofs from the
[Incredible Proof Machine](http://incredible.pm/). I'll eventually go
back and fill all the solutions with holes so people can try them out
on their own, and add some explanatory comments. The goal is that
someone who has read an Agda tutorial and worked some of the
Incredible Proof Machine problems will be able to follow along and
come up with their own solutions.

I avoided using the Agda standard library entirely, in the hopes that
the connection between Incredible Proof Machine's logic and Agda's
logic can be made more clear.
